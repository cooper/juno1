TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Modes e and I (ban exception and invite exception)
I'm going to add a mode for oper override to prevent accidental abuse. Whether or not you can use it should be up to your o-line in the config.
The linking protocol doesn't send privmsgs... we need to send to servers with a client involved only for ethical reasons.
Fix a few linking protocol bugs (mainly in TOPIC command)
Write services to show off my linking protocol
G-line (a global kline) I plan on sending a KLINE command to all servers and writing a k-line to the config, but we'll see
and a lot more that I haven't decided (yet).


What I've done
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We actually check if an rDNS resolves now, and if not use the user's IP address instead.
Prefixes ~ & and % (owner, admin, and halfop +q +a and +h)
Multi-prefix names output
CAP reply
Channel link (+L). if the population limit (+l) is reached, forward you to the linked channel (if there aren't double links)
in viewing of ban and mute list (/mode b|Z), we show full hosts instead of the server name (... @ that)
We now check if a ban/mute mask is valid (fail for not checking before) +b fgt = fgt!*@* +b fgt@* = *!fgt@* +Z *@* = *!*@*
Channel mode +Z, mutes. (Similar to charybdis's quiet, +q)
Now checks for bans and mutes on privmsg.. (fail for not checking for bans before)
Fixed kline, and added the ability for operators to kline via IRC. After a mask is klined, existing users that match the mask are killed.
Almost completely rewrote the linking protocol. Now sends and recieves bursts properly, MODE, TOPIC, JOIN, and PART commands. (PRIVMSG is being worked on)
Now responds to LAG pings from XChat
Network name configuration option
and a lot of bug fixes
